1. Used react router to nevigate from page to page. 
2. In Home page there is a header, and few cards are shown by using the given api.
3. If some want to take a quiz they can click the button of the desired topics and it will take them to different route where they can take the quiz. If the answer they have selected is correct a toast will apear and say it is the correct answer and if the answer is incorrect it will say incorrect. There is also an eye icon, if pressed user can see the correct answer. 
4. Statistic page, I have shown a line chart of the total no of question of each topics. I used react chart to do so.
5. Blog page, I have shown the answer of the given question.
6. All the pages are responsive. I used react-bootstrap to make the cards and navbar.
